# PCA and Feature Extraction Project

This repository contains Python implementations of various deep learning algorithms for classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and feature extraction.

## Overview

The project includes implementations of the following algorithms:

1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:
    - PCA is implemented for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.
    - The algorithm computes the principal components and reconstructs the data based on the selected components.

2. **Adaptive Resonance Theory 1 (ART1) Network**:
    - The ART1 network is implemented for clustering unlabeled data.
    - It trains the network on the Iris dataset and predicts clusters.
    - The repository also includes visualization of clusters and prototypes in bottom-up and top-down space.

## Contents

- **PCA**:
    - Implementation of PCA algorithm.
    - Visualization of transformed data in a scatter plot.
    - Computation of covariance matrix.

- **ART1 Network**:
    - Implementation of ART1 network for clustering.
    - Training the network on the Iris dataset.
    - Visualization of clusters and prototypes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

    ```bash
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

3. Run the Python scripts for the algorithms you want to use:

    - For PCA: `python pca.py`
    - For ART1 Network: `python art1_network.py`

4. View the output and visualizations provided by the scripts.
